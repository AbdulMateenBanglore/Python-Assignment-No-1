    "1. Class\n",
    " a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    " objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables.\n",
    "3. Attribute\n",
    " classes and objects have attributes. Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance.\n",
    "4. Behavior\n",
    " The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure. Methods determine what type of functionality a class has, how it modifies its data, and its overall behavior.\n"
